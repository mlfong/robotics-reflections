    <p>
		Part 1 </br>
		The first part of assignment 1 was not too hard -- merely following formulas and converting to SI units. </br>
		</br> </br>
		Part 2 </br>
		After a lesson on PID controllers, we got to play around with Pololu robots -- tweaking the Kp, Ki, Kd and elapse time values. 
		We settled on Kp = 100, Ki = 50000, and Kd = 3/10. </br> We changed a bit of the elapsed time (just enough to be the first group to notice the immediate turn as shown in Fig 2). </br> </br>

		It was really cool seeing the robot move and while we weren't able to get a second run in, it gave a lot of insight into the fickleness of dealing with hardware (especially sensors). </br>
