		In the week before spring break we went aerial and got dangerous. Parrot's AR Drone 2.0 Quadricopter. Wi-fi enabled with a crisp camera, this was a perfect opportunity to get a grasp on the computer vision side of robotics. 
		</br></br>
		This assignment was split into three parts. The first was just to run the drone programmatically and plot it's angular and linear velocities. Fairly simple, nothing much different from our previous project with the Rovio.
