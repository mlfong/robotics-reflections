		In the week before spring break we went aerial and got dangerous. Parrot's AR Drone 2.0 Quadricopter. Wi-fi enabled with a crisp camera, this was a perfect opportunity to get a grasp on the computer vision side of robotics. 
		</br></br>
		This assignment was split into three parts. The first was just to run the drone programmatically and plot it's angular and linear velocities. Fairly simple, nothing much different from our previous project with the Rovio. 
		</br>

		The second part was back to simulution. We did a bit of visual servoing where we took world points and turned them into camera points, with some green points as our target and our projections as red poitns. Our objective was to then move our camera so that our projections would match the targets.

		In addition we tinkered with some of the possible visual servoing parameters such as our good old Kp component (PID anyone?) and varying distance approximations. 
		</br>
		Out last part of the assignment involved running actual visual servoing on the drone. Our end goal was to be able to fly towards the middle of a CMYK pattern, as shown below. </br>

		Essentially we took the experience we got from part 2 (the simulation) and applied it to a real world setting. Of course reality is not as rosy as a simulation, even with noise taken into account. In practice, and as we saw, things are not perfect. We messed with the thresholds and sampled the pattern under different lighting and locations but we were only successful for 2/3 pattern circles. Ultimately cyan got the better of us, but as is with the pattern of robotics -- nothing is perfect all the time.

		I will leave this assignment with another video, successful drone landing! (From part 1 of this assignment). </br>
