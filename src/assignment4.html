		So assignment 4 we worked with the Rovio robot, this Wi-Fi enabled robot made from Wowwee. Unfortunately to us all, we didn't get to play with individual or new robots, which would have been wonderful, but at the same point we probably got a really nice first person look at one of the cruxes of robotics. Because of limited resources nad potentially faulty hardware, there will always be frustrations when working with robotics. </br></br>
		In this assignment we tackled two ways of calculating robot movements. One by dead reckoning, where we did experiments and got data back based on the robot's location relative to two "north star" lights shone on the ceiling. The other by odometry, where we use wheel encoder values that are independent of the lights. We then compare these two against our predictions and see which provides the most accurate answer. The answer? None of them are that great. The Rovio is a very simple robot that has a little bit over 10 commands (foward, backward, rotate right, etc) that has to be set with a speed and a duration. 
		</br></br>
		The robot's movement were very sporadic and no two commands yielded the same results. This made dead reckoning inaccurate. Our right encoder had it's moments and didn't always return good results, just staying at near zero values a lot. This made odometry inaccurate. 
		</br></br>
		So figuring out where the robot would go is very hard, and I think that is the largest lesson learned here. Even if we ran a hundred more trials and fixed the encoder, unless we can ensure that our robot can be less noisy in movements (impossible), with the Rovio, this is almost impossible to achieve. Overall I didn't particularly like this assignment, I don't think trying to get six people to have a good shared schedule with only a week to do the project was a good idea. Anyways, my final thou--<span style= "font-family: 'Geo', sans-serif; font-size:130%;">Woah woah woah Rovio robot does not like this blog post. So what if I am a bit faulty!? That's robotics for you! I've had enough of this I'm going home...</span>
